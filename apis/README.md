# APIs

As a plugin, you have two APIs to interact with: the [plugin-scoped API](the-plugin-api.md) and the [user-scoped API](the-user-api.md).

The plugin-scoped API handles plugin-level concepts, like managing jobs and interacting with our key/values storage system.

The user-scoped API is the "regular" API that interacts with Envoy's resources like entries and invites.

Both APIs require separate access tokens.
